 # HIVE compatibile
 
 To use this you need
 1. https://gitforwindows.org/  and generate ssh rsa keys to login into your Hive node ( user user ) without prompt for password,  only one node will by used for benchmarks. (more info https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/ )
 2. edit file Include.ps1  line 188  - change to your Hive IP node - this is used for benchmark results
 3. edit file /Bin/ccminer.bat   - change to you Hive IP or/and add more nodes
 4. files from hive-script must be copied into Hive nodes   ( swap.sh  , swap_ccminer.py  ) to /home/user/

Additional features list

   prerun
   
      Ability to run a batch prior switching to a specific algo.
      For example, can be used to set per algo OC via nvidiaInspector
      Simply create a file named <AlgoName>.bat in prerun folder
      If <AlgoName>.bat does not exist, will try to launch prerun/default.bat
      Use overclock with caution
 
   ahashpoolplus / zergpoolplus / zpoolplus / blazepoolplus
   
      Simply use -PoolName ahashpoolplus or other <pool>plus in start.bat
      Uses calculations based on 24hractual and currentestimate ahashpool prices to get more realistic estimate.
      Includes some trust index based on past 1hr currentestimate variation from 24hr.
      AND is NOT sensible to spikes.
      This shows less switching than following Current Estimate and more switching that following the 24hr Actual.
      Better profitability.

   Earnings Tracking
   
      Displays BTC/H and BTC/D as well a estimation of when the pool payment threshold will be reached.
      Supported pools:
            ahashpool
            zergpool
            zpool
            nicehash
      If mining more that one pools, shows stats for any supported pool
      Enabled by default. use "-TrackEarnings $false" in start<pool>.bat to fully disable.
      Press key e in the window to show/hide earnings

   Algo switching log
   
      Simple algo switching log in csv switching.log file found in Logs folder.
      You can easily track switching rate.
      
   Display Options
   
      Use -UIStyle Light or -UIStyle Full in start.bat
            Full = Usual display (Default)
            Light = Show only currently mining info 
      UIStyle automaticaly swtiches to Full during benchmarking.

   In session display toggle
   
      Press key s in the window to switch between light and full display
      Press key e in the window to show/hide earnings 
      Will toggle(switch) display at next refresh

instructions:

edit startpoolname.bat

1.change BTC address to yours

2.select how many gpu's you have eg: (1gpu dstm 0 cc 0) (2gpu dstm 0 1 cc 0,1) (6gpu dstm 0 1 2 3 4 5 cc 0,1,2,3,4,5)

3.remove any algos you do not want to mine

4.save & run startpoolname.bat

note. instruction number 1 : is different for miningpoolhub, you need to change user name and worker name

If you have Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, please update PowerShell:

CCMiner may need 'MSVCR120.dll' if you don't already have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

CCMiner may need 'VCRUNTIME140.DLL' if you don't already have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

running multiple cards its recommended to increase Virtual Memory 64gb is optimal

Requires nvidia driver newer than 388

Made For & Tested with 6x10603gb 6x1070 6x1070ti 6x1080ti (users have reported up to 12cards working have not tested myself)

there is a 5minute per day fee (0.3%) that can be changed to minimum 1minute per day by adding -Donate 1 to startpool.bat

-ActiveMinerGainPct (percent of advantage that active miner has over candidates in term of profit (default 3%)

24hr.bats.. eg. startahashpool24hr.bat  startzpool24hr.bat.. (uses last 24hour Actual API too request profit)
   -Low switching rate
plus.bats.. eg. startahashpoolplus.bat  startzpoolplus.bat.. (uses advanced calculations to maximize profit)
   -Best switching rate
normal .bats uses estimates.. eg. startahashpool.bat   startzpool.bat..   (uses current estimate API too request profit)
